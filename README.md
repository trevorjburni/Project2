# TV Trivia

In this project our team developed an app that lets a user log in and get a score from answering 5 triva questions. 

Deployed app can be found here: https://project2kst.herokuapp.com/.

To begin, click the link above and click login, the website will tell you that you need to enter a email and password, this can be ignored as the requirement has been removed for demonstration purposes.

You will then be taken to an instruction page, read the instructions then click start

The application will then ask you to start the game, when you click start you will be faced with 5 questions about TV questions that are randomly pulled in from an API.

Once you click submit, your score will be shown at the top of the screen. From here you can play again.
